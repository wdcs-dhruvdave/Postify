Task: Manage Posts with Context and CRUD Operations
Build a post management interface that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts using a dummy REST API.
Requirements:
  Display a list of posts
   -Show a list of posts fetched from the API, including title and body.
  Add Post
  -Provide a form to add a new post.
  -On submit, the new post should be added to the list.
  
  Edit Post
   -Allow editing an existing post.
   -On submit, update the post in the list.
  
  Delete Post
   -Include a delete button to remove the post from the list.
  Loading and Empty States
   -Show a loading message while data is being fetched.
  Show a message if no posts are available.
API to Use:
 -Base URL: https://dummyjson.com/posts
 -Endpoints:
   - GET /posts
   - GET /posts/{id}
   - POST /posts/add
   - PUT /posts/{id}
   - DELETE /posts/{id}
You must use Context API for managing global post state.
(+ bonus if implemented with a custom hook for reusable logic.)
